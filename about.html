        <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
        <p class="INFO">I am a Teacher who has had ten years of experience in regards to my
        teaching career, I have taught students of O'Levels for twelve years in the precarious
        subjects of Maths and Physics. I am currently teaching at various institutions and also
        a private school for two years. My intent is to educate and make sure my students excel
        in subjects that are hard to crack as of there requirements. I also try to make sure
        children do not only study but take interest in the subject and not take it as a chore.
