<h1>WHAT WE OFFER?</h1>
<div class="card"><h2>LEARNING CAN BE SCARY</h2><p class="TORENT">BUT IT CAN ALSO BE INCREDIBLY FUN, Which is why we prefer to teach
them the easy way and make learning more enjoyable and fun as well as make students more attracted to studies rather than consider 
it a chore.
</p></p></div>
<div class="ecard"><h2>TO HELP THEM ACHEIVE</h2><p class="TORENT">
As teachers it is our most important duty to help our pupils grow more educated and satisfied rather than disoriented towards studies 
Which is why we always make sure that with us you never feel as if it is just another teacher-student hassle but a family oriented 
environment where the pupils feel like home and never hesitate to ask the true meaning of what they study.
</p></div>
<div class="bcard"><h2>MAKE THEM PRODUCTIVE MEMBERS OF SOCIETY</h2><p class="TORENT">
We want them to know that it is important to learn that they are required as contributors and team players to the upcoming global SOCIETY
and are required to take a throughly interest in development but we intent to explain this in a proper manner rather than enforce for the 
sake of "just a responsibility" but with a keen interest and love for society.
